This procject was made for my master's thesis. It is made up of S7-1500 PLC that is the brains of the operation and 2 HMI pannels. 
One HMI pannel is made using TIA portal so that the tags can be easily tested and the other one is a web page that was made with Visual Studio Code using HTML, CSS and JS programming languages.

The goal of my thesis was to make this system and to test the cybersecurity aspect of the web server that is running on the PLC.
