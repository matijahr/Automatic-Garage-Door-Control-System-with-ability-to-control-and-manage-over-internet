<b>Automatic Garage Door Control System with ability to control and manage over internet</b>

This paper is based on making an automatic garage door system with a human-machine interface. Automatic control system was made using a PLC S7-1513-1 PN and TIA Portal and the code was written in LAD and SCL programming languages.
Also, a human-machine interface was made using Visual Studio Code that enables controlling of the system and is uploaded to the PLCâ€™s web server. Human-machine interface was programmed using HTML, CSS and JS programming languages.
Automatic control system was manually tested with an HMI panel that was made using TIA Portal and the human-machine interface was tested by watching variable response inside data block within TIA Portal.
After testing, some cybersecurity aspects of the system were dealt with using Siemens Security Advisories and a brute force attack was done using Hydra tool.
